A basic program that calculates the bounciness of different types of balls.

The user selects the desired ball, then inputs the initial drop height and the threshold height.
Definitions of these values are given in the program itself.

A summary of the simulation is given, including the simulation parameters and general statistics about the ball, including the number of bounces and a log of the bounce heights.

The user inputs are validated, if you are having trouble inputing values with a decimal point, try using a comma instead of a period.
