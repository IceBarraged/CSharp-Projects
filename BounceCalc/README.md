A basic program that calculates the bounciness of different types of balls.

## Features

* The user selects the desired ball, then inputs the initial drop height and the threshold height.
  Definitions of these values are given in the program itself.
* A summary of the simulation is given, including the simulation parameters and general statistics about the ball, including the number of bounces and a log of   the bounce heights.
* The user inputs are validated, if you are having trouble inputing values with a decimal point, try using a comma instead of a period.
